  <!-- Short Summary -->
  <p>
    A Thousand Hills: Rwanda's Rebirth and the Man Who Dreamed 
    It is the story of Paul Kagame, a refugee who, after a generation 
    of exile, found his way home. Learn about President Kagame, 
    who strives to make Rwanda the first middle-income country in Africa, 
    in a single generation. In this adventurous tale, learn about Kagameâ€™s 
    early fascination with Che Guevara and James Bond, his years as an 
    intelligence agent, his training in Cuba and the United States, 
    the way he built his secret rebel army, his bloody rebellion, 
    and his outsized ambitions for Rwanda.

  <!-- Personal Statement -->
  <p>
    This book has opened my mind possibly more than any other book! 
    Partly due to my young age but also due to Kinzer's well-researched, 
    well-written style. Not only did I learn about Rwanda, the genocide, 
    Paul Kangame and his part in the rebirth of Rwanda, but I also learned 
    about how specific world leaders, countries, the U.N. and even the 
    Catholic Church played a part in the genocide. More and more I lament 
    the lack of world news that are given to the whole world 
    (without having to dig for it). This is a must-read for everyone!!
