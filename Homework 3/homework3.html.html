  <h1><p><center><h3>Homemade French Fries Recipe</h3></center></p></h1>
  <p>
    French fries, or simply fries, chips, finger chips, or French-fried 
    potatoes, are batonnet or allumette-cut deep-fried potatoes. 
    French fries are served hot, either soft or crispy, and are 
    generally eaten as part of lunch or dinner or by themselves 
    as a snack, and they commonly appear on the menus of diners, 
    fast food restaurants, pubs, and bars. They are usually salted 
    and, depending on the country, may be served with ketchup, 
    vinegar, mayonnaise, tomato sauce, or other local specialties.
    I like french fries so much because they are so tasty and they have
    been my favorite meal ever since i was a small child.
